# Unambiguous grammar in C
The "basic C" programming language implementation project involves developing a programming language that supports integer constants, variables, expressions, assignments, for loops, read and write statements. The language requires the first statement to be a declaration-statement, where variables of integer type can be declared. The language also allows forming expressions using arithmetic and comparison operators, with appropriate precedence and associativity rules. For loops should be enclosed in braces, and all statements should be separated by semicolons. The project requires creating an unambiguous grammar G for the language and developing a C program that constructs a syntax tree representing the program's structure. Additionally, the program will simulate the execution of the given program, handle read and write statements, variable assignments, and prompt users for input during runtime if needed. The output of the program, along with the syntax tree, will be printed on the console/terminal. This project provides an opportunity to delve into language design, parsing, and interpretation, empowering developers to gain practical experience in building a functional programming language.
